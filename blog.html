                        ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

                        These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.

                        Variables declared with let/const inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block.
                        <br>
                        Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.

                        Variables declared with var inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.
                    </td>
                    <td>Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.

                        Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.

                        Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.

                        They all have Global Scope. </td>

                <h3 class="text-center mb-4">Q3. How does JavaScript event loop work?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from
                    the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the
                    Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the
                    Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.
